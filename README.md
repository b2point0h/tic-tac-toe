Build an Interactive Form
================================

## Requirements

- [X] When the page loads, the startup screen should appear.

- [X] Add programming, so that when the player clicks the start button the start screen disappears, the board appears, and the game begins. Use the tictactoe-02-inprogress.png mockup, and the board.txt

- [X] Play alternates between X and O.

- [X] The current player is indicated at the top of the page

- [X] When the current player mouses over an empty square on the board, it's symbol the X or O should appear on the square.

- [X] Players can only click on empty squares. When the player clicks on an empty square, attach the class box-filled-1 (for O) or box-filled-2 (for X) to the square.

- [X] The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If all of the squares are filled and no players have three in a row the game is a tie.

- [X] Add programming so that when the game ends, the board disappears and the game end screen appears.

- [X] Add programming so that when a player pushes the "New Game" button, the board appears again, empty and a new game begins.

- [X] Use the module pattern to wrap all of your JavaScript code into a single global variable or an immediately invoked function.


## Extra Credit

- [] Let a player add their name before the game starts

- [] Add programming to support playing against the computer. Only one player plays, the other is controlled by your programming.
